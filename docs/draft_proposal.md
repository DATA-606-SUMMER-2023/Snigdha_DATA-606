# Data 606: Capstone project proposal

# Building a Recommendation System through the IMDB movie ratings

## Introduction
A recommender system is an algorithmic approach to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and interests. It analyzes user behavior, historical data, and item characteristics to suggest relevant items that the user might like or find useful. Recommender systems are widely used in various domains, such as e-commerce, streaming platforms, and content-based websites, to help users discover new items and enhance their overall experience by reducing the information overload and improving the relevance of recommendations.
