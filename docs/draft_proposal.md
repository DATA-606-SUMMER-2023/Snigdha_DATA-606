# Building a Recommendation System through the IMDB movie ratings

## Introduction
A recommender system is an algorithmic approach to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and interests. It analyzes user behavior, historical data, and item characteristics to suggest relevant items that the user might like or find useful. Recommender systems are widely used in various domains, such as e-commerce, streaming platforms, and content-based websites, to help users discover new items and enhance their overall experience by reducing the information overload and improving the relevance of recommendations.

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a recommender system using the IMDb movie dataset from Kaggle. The recommender system will provide personalized movie recommendations to users, helping them discover relevant movies based on their preferences and the rich information available in the dataset.

## Dataset
This dataset is having the data of 2.5 Million Movies/series listed on the official website of IMDB

Features:
- id - Movie ID
- name - Name of the Movie
- year - Year of movie release
- rating - Rating of the Movie
- certificate - Movie Certification
- duration - Duration of the Movie
- genre - Genre of the Movie
- votes - Number of people who voted for the IMDB rating
- gross_income - Gross Income of the Movie
- directors_id - ID of Directors who have worked on the movie

## Research Interests
What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?
What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you have in the datasets for analysis?
What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?
What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?
How you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?
What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?
How do you deploy the trained model for use (example: using Streamlit, Dash, Flask, Solara, etc. to develop a web app or dashboard)
